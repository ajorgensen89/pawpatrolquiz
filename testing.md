## CSS
The code written for CSS can be tested using [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). It flags any issues with what has been created to help improve the website and make it function correctly. <br>

## JSHint
[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to check javascript while building the project. It would help and flag up errors and suggestions to work on. <br>
Unneccessary semi-colons were removed and not needed. On one instance, the code stopped working so I placed the semi-colon back in. It also helped indentify incorrectly assigned variable, which helped improve the javascript code.<br>
While building javascript and code, some items get left behind. The [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) helped removed any unneeded parts that might have been accidentily left in.

## Multiple Browers
The website, after being deployed was tested to ensure it ran the wesbite and its content on different broswers. This can be used to test the websites perfermance, search engine optimization and accessibility for future users.
